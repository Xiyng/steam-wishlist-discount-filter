# Steam Wishlist Price Filter

Steam Wishlist Price Filter is a userscript that adds the option to filter games
by price or show only discounted items in your Steam wishlist. If you're
interested in using/downloading the script,
[this page](https://xiyng.github.io/steam-wishlist-price-filter/) is probably
what you're looking for.

**Note**: The script is currently broken and probably will remain that way
because of the way the current wishlist page works. It might be possible to
modify the script to support the new page, but it seems like a lot of work for
relatively little gain, considering that the new wishlist page implements a lot
of the same functionality as this script.
